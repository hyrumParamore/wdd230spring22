            <p>My name is Courtney Cook. I have 6 kids, 3 boys and 3 girls and I love them very much! <br>
                I use this website to help myself to understand more about the area in which I live 
                to further help others that I come across who stand in need of anything. My kids and I always go to
                the community events and help out with the different booths to promote this chamber and the 
                members and businesses that are part of it.

            <p>My name is Derick McKinney, I am 34 years old and recently got married to my beautiful wife Josie. <br>
                My wife and I recently moved here and thanks to the chamber helping us find the
                perfect realtor, we were able to find an amazing home to live in. <br>
                I am a proud supporter of the Hines Choice Chambers because they helped me when I was in need. I had
                no one else to turn to. I recently started my own business, and thanks again to the chamber, I have been able
                to unite with other businesses in the community to buid each other up. It has been a huge help!
