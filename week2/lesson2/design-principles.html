                        their pages. They really focus on keeping it all symetrical.

                    <p class="content">One thing that I noticed with Amazon's website was that
                        there is a lot of repetition. This repetition is huge when in larger
                        businesses because it allows them to implement elements of their company's 
                        brand identity into their pages anad websites.

                    <p class="content">While Nintendo's website also imlpements a lot of repetition 
                        they also implement the design principle of contrast into the website.
                        Nintendo is known for colorfull video games and artwork, and they implemented
                        that into their website very well with the different colors of game images and 
                        using colors to help navigate throughout the website and help make the website 
                        pleasing to the eye.
